laboetie is an elektrokinetic lattice boltzmann code with lots of things to work on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Written by Maximilien Levesque while in postdoc at Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France, under the supervision of Benjamin Rotenberg.

It is written on the basis of a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) code by Capuani, Frenkel, Rottenberg et al.(?).

laboetie is written in modern fortran (2003+), with allocatable arrays. It is object oriented (OO), with modules, in order to be as easy to modify as possible.

HOW TO BUILD
------------

You need to have scons installed. It is a modern "make" with much easier syntax and above all a very good dependence tracking.
Once installed, just type:
$ scons

That's all.
