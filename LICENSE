The purpose of this license is to make you aware of the following point.

This program is written from almost scratch because the original grogram in C by Capuani had transformed in such a mess, due to a pilling of postdocs, phd etc working on the code on their side, that it was more time to learn the code than rewritting (for me).

I propose:
# Every person that download the source and modify it should use git to get versioning of the src and that one can later do a diff. PLEASE. It was an effort for me to write the fortran src, it is a question of respect not to throw my efforts away.
# You should cite some of my work if you use this program. Later, I will propose some typical references to be cited.
# To be extended
